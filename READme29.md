# Phase 4 Requirements

In phase 4, we will be tracking every API call and storing it in history

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

As a user, I want to see a list of my previous API calls, so that I can see the results again, quickly
Application Flow:

- User enters an API URL
- Chooses a REST Method
- licks the “Go” button
- Application fetches data from the URL given, with the method specified
- Application stores the API request and returned data into state
- Updates the list of previous API calls
- Application Displays the response headers and results separately
- Both headers and results should be “pretty printed” JSON
